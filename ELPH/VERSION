Motif finder program ELPH (Estimated Locations of Pattern Hits)
 
Version ELPH 1.0.1
 
Changes:

ELPH 1.0.1 : Changed the qsort function to return 1,0,-1 values instead of 1, and 0. The previous version worked fine on Linux, but crashed on Solaris.
 
ELPH 1.0 : New options included: possibility to change the degree
of the Markov chain used to generate sequences for significance of
motif testing; possibility to test significance of an exact match
of the motif in two input files. Also this version ignores sequences
where only N's are present.
 
ELPH 0.1.5 : Option -c fixed.
 
ELPH 0.1.4 : Fixed the display of significant motifs which
was sometimes erronous.
 
ELPH 0.1.3 : The locations of motifs in DNA/AAC sequences
have low probability to contain N's/X's
